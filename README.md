## Amiibo Selector
Amiibo Selector is a web application that allows users to select games and Amiibos from drop-down menus and view corresponding information and images of Amiibos. This application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it fetches data from the Amiibo API to populate the selection options and display Amiibo information.

# Features
. Select a game from the drop-down menu to view Amiibos associated with that game.
. Select an Amiibo from the drop-down menu to view information and an image of that Amiibo.
. Click on an Amiibo card to perform a YouTube search for related content.
# Usage
. Clone this repository to your local machine.
. Open the index.html file in a web browser.
# How It Works

2. The application fetches a list of Amiibo options (defaulted to "Mario" Amiibos) from the Amiibo API and populates the Amiibo select dropdown.
3. When a game is selected from the game select dropdown, the application fetches and displays Amiibos associated with that game.
4. When an Amiibo is selected from the Amiibo select dropdown, the application fetches and displays information and an image of that Amiibo.
